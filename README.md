# Arduino Motor Library

## Summary

This library is intended to control motor shields in the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) environment. We assume that the shields are based on the driver circuits L293 or L298 such as the [Arduino Motor Shield Rev3](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-motor-shield-rev3) or the [Velleman Motor & Power Shield](https://www.velleman.eu/products/view/?id=412538). The library can control two DC motors. For the application in mobile robotils, Motor A and Motor B are assumed to be mounted on the left and right hand side, respectively, of the robot's chassis.

## References

The implementation of the library is based on the following books, but has been developed further. The books describe several applications.
